# Three.js---1

Welcome to my Three.js journey! I'm excited to share my projects with you as I explore the world of 3D rendering with Three.js.

Project 1: Raycasting X Click Event Based
This is my first intermediate-level project, showcasing a basic implementation of raycasting with X click event handling. This project demonstrates how to:

- Create a 3D scene with Three.js
- Implement raycasting for object selection
- Handle X click events for interactive functionality

Features
- Interactive 3D scene with raycasting
- X click event handling for object selection
- Basic camera controls for navigation

Technologies Used
- Three.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

Future Plans
I plan to continue exploring Three.js and creating more complex projects, including:

- Advanced lighting and shading techniques
- Physics-based simulations
- Interactive storytelling and animation

Stay tuned for more updates!
